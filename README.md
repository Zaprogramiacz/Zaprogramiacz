### Hi there üëã

My adventure with the iOS platform started over **eight years** ago. I belong to a generation of developers who started out learning how to create mobile iOS applications in **Swift**, but I'm also familiar with Objective-C.

During over eight years of work, I‚Äôve created **7 applications in Swift** from scratch. The experience allowed me to test many solutions, as well as design patterns (MVC, MVVM, Redux) and frameworks in practice.

For the last three years, I have been fighting within **Proton** to make the Internet a private and secure place. I was a member of **Proton Mail** team and currently, I'm working on a new **Proton Calendar** iOS app.
 
**Mentor** at open workshops and hackathons.

I believe in words:

***‚Äúquality over quantity‚Äù***

That's why I love writing **clean**, **tested** code and improving code quality metrics. **TDD** is not only a cool methodology that we see in presentations or during conferences, but also the way of code creation I follow. I know what a **refactor** is and I pay attention to it by doing a very detailed **code review**. 

Beside being familiar with **OOP**, I can apply it in practice without the need to create classes with hundreds of lines. My abilities include **testing UI** by creating **snapshot tests** (so that after changing UI related code while looking for unexpected UI bugs, there‚Äôs no need to go through the whole app manually). 

While writing a code, I follow the correct style and conventions of **Swift**, which is why I‚Äôm using **Swiftlint** linter for every project.

As a code-writing lover I don‚Äôt like wasting time waiting for the project to be built, so I know how to reduce this time to a minimum by **modularizing projects**. 

I‚Äôm a big fan of **reactive programming**, so I implement it where necessary.

I believe that there are better solutions than manual release process or manual check of code correctness before merging. Therefore, I can configure **CI / CD** pipeline using **fastlane** and **Danger** tools to automate manual processes.

I know that **high quality** does matter and I‚Äôm sure that it benefits in the long term. That‚Äôs why while programming I‚Äôm doing my best to avoid creating buggy and not fully working features.
